I went through locally and trimmed the database up.I started with the salaries table and dropped everything that wasn't 2014. From there I dropped any records for players without a salary and any records that were before 2014.

ex)
--Batting SQL
delete from batting where yearId != '2014';
delete from batting where playerId not in (select playerId from salaries);

/*
  Tables
  
  salaries.sql
  master.sql
  batting.sql
  fielding.sql
  pitching.sql
  appearances.sql
  teams.sql
*/
